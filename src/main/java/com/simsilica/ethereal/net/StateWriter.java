            // At this point, we've either fully added the frame to the next
            // outbound message or we had to split it.  If we full added it then
            // the message stays open to see if the next frame will fit... we fall
            // out of this loop.
            // If the frame did NOT fully fit then we got again using the split
            // off part as the new outbound frame... thus all of the bitsRemaining
            // and estimatedSize fixes I made above (2016/06/14).
            // My own testing prior to this probably never had a frame that spanned
            // more than one message and so never hit this.  At last calculation,
            // it takes something like 80 object updates to exceed a message size.
            // And to trigger this bug, we'd have to not only exceed that but
            // also have existing smaller frames already ready to go.
            // (Queued up outbound frames would have made bitsRemaining a small
            // number versus no frames queued in which the bitsRemaining would
            // have been accurate... because empty queue = max bitsRemaining.)
            // Though I guess the partial end of frame we wrote could set us
            // up on the next endFrame() with items already in the queue and an
            // inaccurate bitsRemaining again... so this error case is probably
            // pretty common but for some reason didn't show up in my own meager
            // stress testing.  In the best case, bitsRemaining is wrong but still
            // large enough to fit more data into.  I guess the problem comes when
            // bitsRemaining from whatever was waiting in the outbound queue would
            // be so small that no amount of splitting would fit.  The frame split logic
            // assumes that at least one object update will fit so if we gave it a
            // limit of say, 5 then it would never resolve properly. (Actually, looking
            // at the code it will throw an exception.)  In the case where the message
            // can't be split with the bits remaining we may want to just send the
            // whole frame.  I worry that if we have too many acks built up and a really
            // small MTU that maybe we hit the same issue of non-split... but at least
            // we'll get an exception.
            //
            // Note: The first pass through the loop, calculating bitsRemaining is
            // redundant but costs little.

            // TODO: add a split counter to a statistics object

            // It occurs to me that we can potentially _greatly_ reduce the size

            //    if it turns out to bump us past our max size.  This at least prevents
            //    the double-calc in most cases.
