            // -before we ever received a baseline update, we somehow lost the

            // -I don't know where the other update gets lost, though... was
            //  it in a zone that's now invisible and somehow got lost?
            // -it is absoluately related to message splitting because if splitting
            //  is eliminated then there is no issue.
            // -given that it's related to splitting and crossing zone boundaries,
            //  I suspect it's related to how things like zones are interpretted
            //  between split messages.  For example, the local zone ID can only
            //  by properly interpretted relative to the view center that was in
            //  effect when that message was sent.
            // Note: further experimentation shows that it's hard to nail down
            //  splitting as for sure an issue.  Even with normal message sizes
            //  where splitting would be guaranteed, I cannot make the issue happen
            //  without extreme message lag.  If there is no large message lag
            //  (large enough to trigger warnings about header size) then there doesn't
            //  seem to be an issue.  (Hmmm... I did see it as the warning but not
            //  the later errors.  Interesting.)
            // Also, while I can easily twist my brain into knots that convince
            //  me that local zone index can be wrong maybe for some split messages
            //  or something... I can't use any of that to justify why we never saw
            //  a baseline with a realId.
            //  First I thought maybe the zone IDs weren't being interpretted with
            //  the proper local zone index.  But StateReceiver seems to do a pretty
            //  good job of supplying the local index with the proper center from
            //  the message being interpretted.  Updating the baseline doesn't but
            //  I'm not sure it needs to.  zoneId is just a value and when the player
            //  crosses a zone boundary we should see updates for all of the objects.
            //  ...even if it's effectively the same zone.  (It's only like 9 bits
            //  with most default configs so not as big a deal as it sounds.)
            //  So when we see problems with the zones, I think it's the same problem
            //  as the missing realId... not the cause.  We skipped a baseline somewhere.
            //
            // As a (hopefully temporary) work-around, I'm going to force
            // update the baseline.realId in these cases because in our
            // use-cases it never changes.
            // Note: this just keeps the app from crashing later but doesn't actually
            // solve the issue.  The app keeps running and objects keep updating but
            // the 'hung' shared objects don't seem to resolve.
